            <p>What if Twitter consisted only of dad jokes? Well that's the idea behind this pen.</p>
            <p>Also, it was the occasion to redesign Twitter based on the july 2019 #newtwitter teasing, all done from tiny screenshots.</p>
            <p>The jokes are fetched from icanhazdad.com API, users are added locally, everything else is Preact or react-router v5: feed, pagination, search, routing, etc.</p>
            <p>There's a LOT of movies/video games references here. Can you spot them all?</p>
